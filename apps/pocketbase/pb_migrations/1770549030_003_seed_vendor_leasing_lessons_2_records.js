ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OVERVIEW\n\nASC 842 (Topic 842 - Leases)\n- Effective for public companies: January 1, 2019\n- Effective for private companies: January 1, 2022\n- Replaces previous lease accounting guidance (ASC 840)\n- Requires recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on balance sheet\n- Applies to all leases except short-term leases (12 months or less)\n\nIFRS 16 (International Financial Reporting Standard 16)\n- Effective: January 1, 2019\n- Replaces IAS 17 (Leases)\n- Similar to ASC 842 but with some differences in application\n- Requires recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities\n- Applies to all leases except short-term and low-value leases\n\n2. LEASE CLASSIFICATION\n\nOperating Leases\n- Lessee does not obtain substantially all benefits and risks of ownership\n- Lease term is less than major part of asset life\n- Present value of lease payments is less than fair value of asset\n- No transfer of ownership at end of lease\n- Accounting: ROU asset and lease liability on balance sheet; straight-line lease expense\n\nFinance Leases (Capital Leases under ASC 840)\n- Lessee obtains substantially all benefits and risks of ownership\n- Lease term is major part of asset life (typically 75% or more)\n- Present value of lease payments is substantial portion of fair value (typically 90% or more)\n- Transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at end of lease\n- Accounting: ROU asset and lease liability; depreciation and interest expense\n\n3. RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nInitial Recognition (Lease Commencement Date)\n- ROU Asset = Lease Liability + Initial Direct Costs - Lease Incentives Received\n- Lease Liability = Present Value of Lease Payments\n- Lease Payments include: Fixed payments, Variable payments (if dependent on index/rate), Residual value guarantees, Termination penalties\n- Discount Rate = Incremental Borrowing Rate (if implicit rate not determinable)\n\nSubsequent Measurement\n- ROU Asset: Depreciated over lease term (straight-line method)\n- Lease Liability: Accreted using effective interest method\n- Lease Expense = Depreciation of ROU Asset + Interest on Lease Liability\n\n4. FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION\n\nBalance Sheet\n- ROU Asset: Presented separately or within property, plant, and equipment\n- Lease Liability: Separated into current and non-current portions\n- Current Lease Liability = Portion due within 12 months\n- Non-Current Lease Liability = Remaining obligation\n\nIncome Statement\n- Operating Leases: Single lease expense (depreciation + interest combined)\n- Finance Leases: Depreciation expense + Interest expense (separate line items)\n\nCash Flow Statement\n- Operating Activities: Interest portion of lease payments\n- Financing Activities: Principal portion of lease payments\n\n5. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\n\nRequired Disclosures\n- Lease term, discount rate, and incremental borrowing rate\n- ROU asset and lease liability balances\n- Lease expense by type (operating vs. finance)\n- Maturity analysis of lease liabilities (undiscounted cash flows)\n- Sublease income and contingent rent\n- Significant judgments and estimates\n- Lease modifications and reassessments\n\n6. IMPACT ON FINANCIAL RATIOS\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio\n- Increases due to recognition of lease liabilities\n- May affect debt covenants and credit ratings\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA)\n- Decreases due to increased asset base (ROU assets)\n- May affect performance metrics\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio\n- Decreases due to additional interest expense on lease liabilities\n- May affect covenant compliance\n\nCurrent Ratio\n- May decrease due to current portion of lease liability\n- Affects liquidity assessment\n\n7. ACCOUNTING FOR LEASE MODIFICATIONS\n\nTypes of Modifications\n- Changes in lease term (extension or termination options exercised)\n- Changes in lease payments (e.g., rent increases)\n- Changes in scope (additional or removed assets)\n\nAccounting Treatment\n- Remeasure ROU asset and lease liability\n- Adjust for changes in lease payments and term\n- Recognize gain/loss if modification reduces lease liability\n- Update depreciation schedule for remaining lease term\n\n8. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES\n\nExample 1: Operating Lease\n- 5-year lease of equipment\n- Annual payment: $100,000\n- Incremental borrowing rate: 5%\n- Initial ROU Asset and Liability: ~$432,948\n- Annual lease expense: ~$86,590 (decreasing interest, increasing depreciation)\n\nExample 2: Finance Lease\n- 7-year lease of machinery\n- Annual payment: $50,000\n- Implicit rate: 6%\n- Initial ROU Asset and Liability: ~$308,319\n- Year 1: Depreciation $44,045 + Interest $18,499 = $62,544 total expense");
