A higher discount rate results in lower present values, favoring the lease option (lower current payments). A lower discount rate results in higher present values, potentially favoring the buy option. The appropriate rate is the company's after-tax cost of debt, typically 4-8%, reflecting the risk of lease payment obligations.");
    record2.set("explanation", "The discount rate is one of the most sensitive variables in lease vs buy analysis. A 1% change in the discount rate can significantly impact the NPV and potentially change the decision.

    record4.set("explanation", "Sensitivity analysis helps understand which variables have the greatest impact on the decision. For example, if the decision is highly sensitive to residual value assumptions, more effort should be spent validating that estimate. Break-even analysis identifies the threshold values where the decision would change, helping management understand decision risk.");

Sensitivity analysis changes one variable at a time. Scenario analysis provides a range of outcomes and probability-weighted results, while sensitivity analysis shows individual variable impacts. Scenario analysis is more realistic but more complex.");
    record5.set("explanation", "Scenario analysis recognizes that variables are often correlated. For example, if interest rates rise (increasing discount rate), residual values might also decline. Scenario analysis captures these relationships. Probability-weighted scenarios provide an expected value that accounts for the likelihood of each scenario occurring.");

This means it takes 3.33 years to recover the initial $5M investment through annual savings. Payback period is a simple metric but doesn't account for time value of money or cash flows after payback.

It's useful for comparing options with different investment sizes.");
    record7.set("explanation", "The profitability index is a relative measure of value creation. An index of 1.15 means that for every dollar of cost, the option generates $1.15 in benefits.

    record8.set("explanation", "Tax effects are critical because they reduce the effective cost of both lease and buy options. The tax rate used should be the company's marginal tax rate.

    record9.set("explanation", "While financial analysis provides the foundation for the decision, qualitative factors often override the numbers. For example, a company might choose to lease despite higher NPV for buying if it provides operational flexibility or preserves balance sheet capacity for other investments.
