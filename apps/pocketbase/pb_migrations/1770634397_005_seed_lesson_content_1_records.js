Initial Measurement\n\n### ROU Asset Calculation\n- IFRS 16: Lease liability + initial direct costs - lease incentives\n- ASC 842: Lease liability + initial direct costs\n- Different treatment of incentives\n\n### Lease Liability Calculation\n- Both standards: Present value of lease payments\n- IFRS 16: Uses IBR as primary method\n- ASC 842: Uses implicit rate if available\n\n### Initial Direct Costs\n- IFRS 16: Excluded from ROU asset (expensed)\n- ASC 842: Included in ROU asset\n- Significant difference in initial measurement\n\n### Lease Incentives\n- IFRS 16: Reduces ROU asset\n- ASC 842: Reduces lease liability\n- Different balance sheet presentation");
