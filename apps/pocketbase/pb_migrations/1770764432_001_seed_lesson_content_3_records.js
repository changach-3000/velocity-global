Understanding the different lease types is essential for selecting the appropriate lease structure for specific situations. This lesson covers the major types of equipment leases and their characteristics.</p>\n\n<h3>Operating Leases</h3>\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>An operating lease is a lease where the lessor retains substantially all risks and benefits of equipment ownership. The lessee has the right to use the equipment but does not own it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lessor Ownership:</strong> Lessor retains ownership and bears residual value risk</li>\n<li><strong>Short Term:</strong> Lease term is typically short (1-3 years)</li>\n<li><strong>Cancellable:</strong> Lessee may have right to cancel lease</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Lessor typically responsible for maintenance</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Lessee records right-of-use asset and lease liability</li>\n<li><strong>Tax:</strong> Lessor claims depreciation; lessee deducts lease payments</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower monthly payments than capital leases</li>\n<li>Flexibility to upgrade equipment</li>\n<li>Lessor responsible for maintenance</li>\n<li>No residual value risk for lessee</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No ownership at lease end</li>\n<li>May be more expensive over long term</li>\n<li>Lessor bears residual value risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Practical Example:</strong> A company leases a vehicle for 2 years with operating lease:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly payment: $400</li>\n<li>Lessor responsible for maintenance and insurance</li>\n<li>Lessee can cancel with 30 days notice</li>\n<li>At lease end, vehicle is returned to lessor</li>\n<li>Lessor bears risk if vehicle value is lower than expected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Capital Leases</h3>\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>A capital lease (also called finance lease) is a lease where the lessee assumes substantially all risks and benefits of equipment ownership. The lessee effectively purchases the equipment through the lease.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lessee Ownership:</strong> Lessee assumes risks and benefits of ownership</li>\n<li><strong>Long Term:</strong> Lease term is typically long (3-7 years)</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Cancellable:</strong> Lease is non-cancellable</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Lessee typically responsible for maintenance</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Lessee records equipment as asset and lease as liability</li>\n<li><strong>Tax:</strong> Lessee claims depreciation; lessor reports lease income</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower total cost over lease term</li>\n<li>Lessee controls equipment</li>\n<li>Lessee can claim depreciation</li>\n<li>Predictable costs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher monthly payments</li>\n<li>Lessee bears residual value risk</li>\n<li>Lessee responsible for maintenance</li>\n<li>Less flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Practical Example:</strong> A company leases manufacturing equipment for 5 years with capital lease:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equipment cost: $500,000</li>\n<li>Monthly payment: $8,500</li>\n<li>Lessee responsible for maintenance</li>\n<li>Lease is non-cancellable</li>\n<li>At lease end, lessee can purchase equipment for residual value</li>\n<li>Lessee bears risk if equipment value is lower than expected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Fair Market Value Leases</h3>\n<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>A fair market value (FMV) lease is a lease where the residual value is determined by the fair market value of the equipment at lease end, typically through an independent appraisal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Residual Value:</strong> Residual value is determined at lease end, not at inception</li>\n<li><strong>Appraisal:</strong> Independent appraisal determines residual value</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Provides flexibility in residual value</li>\n<li><strong>Risk Sharing:</strong> Lessor and lessee share residual value risk</li>\n<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Monthly payments are typically lower than fixed residual leases</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower monthly payments</li>\n<li>Flexibility in residual value</li>\n<li>Fair market value determined objectively</li>\n<li>Lessor and lessee share risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty about residual value</li>\n<li>Appraisal costs</li>\n<li>Potential disputes about residual value</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Different Lease Structures</h3>\n<p><strong>Structure 1: Direct Lease</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Lessor purchases equipment and leases directly to lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Parties:</strong> Lessor and lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple structure, direct relationship</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Lessor bears all risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Structure 2: Vendor Lease</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Lessor purchases equipment from vendor and leases to lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Parties:</strong> Lessor, vendor, and lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Lessor can leverage vendor relationships</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex structure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Structure 3: Sale-Leaseback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Lessee sells equipment to lessor and leases it back</li>\n<li><strong>Parties:</strong> Lessor and lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Generates cash for lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Lessee loses ownership</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Structure 4: Leveraged Lease</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Lessor finances equipment purchase with debt</li>\n<li><strong>Parties:</strong> Lessor, lender, and lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Lessor can leverage capital</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex, higher risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Lease Type Comparison</h3>\n<p><strong>Operating vs. Capital Lease Comparison:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lease Term:</strong> Operating: short (1-3 years); Capital: long (3-7 years)</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> Operating: lower; Capital: higher</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Operating: lessor; Capital: lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Operating: lessor; Capital: lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Residual Risk:</strong> Operating: lessor; Capital: lessee</li>\n<li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> Operating: higher over long term; Capital: lower over long term</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Practical Example:</strong> Comparing lease types for a $100,000 vehicle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating Lease:</strong> $400/month for 2 years; total cost $9,600; no ownership</li>\n<li><strong>Capital Lease:</strong> $1,800/month for 5 years; total cost $108,000; ownership at end</li>\n<li><strong>Purchase:</strong> $100,000 upfront; maintenance and insurance additional; ownership immediate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selecting the Right Lease Type</h3>\n<p><strong>Factors to Consider:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Equipment Life:</strong> How long will equipment be needed?</li>\n<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Will equipment become obsolete?</li>\n<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Will equipment be heavily used?</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Who should be responsible for maintenance?</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Does lessee need flexibility to upgrade?</li>\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> What is the total cost of ownership?</li>\n<li><strong>Accounting:</strong> What is the accounting treatment?</li>\n<li><strong>Tax:</strong> What are the tax implications?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Operating leases are short-term with lessor bearing residual risk</li>\n<li>Capital leases are long-term with lessee bearing residual risk</li>\n<li>Fair market value leases have residual value determined at lease end</li>\n<li>Different lease structures serve different purposes</li>\n<li>Lease type selection depends on equipment, usage, and objectives</li>\n<li>Operating leases provide flexibility;
