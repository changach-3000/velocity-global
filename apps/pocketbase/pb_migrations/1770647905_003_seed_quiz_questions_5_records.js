When clients see only one option (the lease), they may feel pressured or limited. Multiple options create a sense of control and empowerment, making clients more likely to choose one of your proposals. The anchoring effect means the first option presented becomes the reference point for all others. Clients feel more confident when they can compare options and make an informed decision. The optimal number of options is three - not too few, not too many.");

The first number or option presented becomes the reference point for all subsequent judgments. In lease proposals, you can use this strategically by presenting your preferred option (the lease) first. Make sure the lease option looks attractive, then present other options as alternatives to the anchor. Clients will naturally compare everything to the first option, making the lease appear more economical. For example, if you present a lease at $5,000/month first, then a hybrid at $6,500/month and a purchase at $8,200/month, clients will see the lease as the most economical option.");
