Understanding how to structure leases effectively is what separates top performers from average salespeople. Lease structuring impacts deal closure rates, client satisfaction, and profitability.\n\nKey Importance:\n- Flexibility: Different structures serve different client needs\n- Customization: Tailor solutions to match business cycles and cash flow patterns\n- Competitive Advantage: Creative structures win deals competitors can't\n- Deal Structuring Art: Combining financial knowledge with sales acumen\n\nThe art of deal structuring is about understanding your client's business deeply and creating a lease structure that feels like a natural fit for their operations.\n\n---\n\nSECTION A - FMV VS $1 BUYOUT\n\nFMV LEASE (Fair Market Value Lease):\nDefinition: A lease where the equipment is returned to the lessor at lease end, with the lessor retaining residual value risk and benefit.\n\nKey Characteristics:\n- Equipment returned at end of lease term\n- Lessor owns residual value\n- Typically lower monthly payments\n- More flexibility for clients\n- Lessor bears residual value risk\n\n$1 BUYOUT LEASE:\nDefinition: A lease where the lessee can purchase the equipment for $1 at lease end, effectively transferring ownership.\n\nKey Characteristics:\n- Lessee owns equipment at end of lease\n- Lessee bears residual value risk\n- Typically higher monthly payments\n- Accounting treated as capital lease\n- Certainty of ownership\n\nKEY DIFFERENCES:\n1. Ownership: FMV = lessor retains; $1 = lessee acquires\n2. Residual Risk: FMV = lessor risk; $1 = lessee risk\n3. Payments: FMV = lower; $1 = higher\n4. Flexibility: FMV = higher; $1 = lower\n5. Accounting: FMV = operating lease; $1 = capital lease\n\nGAAP/IFRS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT:\nFMV Lease:\n- Operating lease treatment\n- Off-balance sheet (under ASC 842, now on-balance sheet with right-of-use asset)\n- Expense recognition over lease term\n- Lower impact on debt ratios\n\n$1 Buyout Lease:\n- Capital lease treatment\n- On-balance sheet as asset and liability\n- Depreciation expense\n- Higher impact on debt ratios\n- Affects financial metrics\n\nTAX IMPLICATIONS:\nFMV Lease:\n- Lessor claims depreciation\n- Lessee deducts lease payments\n- More favorable for lessor tax position\n- Lessee gets expense deduction\n\n$1 Buyout Lease:\n- Lessee claims depreciation\n- Lessee gets ownership benefits\n- Different tax treatment\n- Ownership tax advantages\n\nWHEN TO RECOMMEND EACH:\nRecommend FMV Lease When:\n- Client wants lower monthly payments\n- Client values flexibility\n- Client doesn't want equipment ownership\n- Client wants to upgrade equipment regularly\n- Client prefers off-balance sheet treatment\n- Client has strong cash flow but wants flexibility\n\nRecommend $1 Buyout When:\n- Client wants to own equipment\n- Client plans long-term equipment use\n- Client wants ownership certainty\n- Client prefers capital lease treatment\n- Client wants depreciation benefits\n- Client has specific equipment needs");

You get the equipment you need now, with lower payments, and the flexibility to upgrade or return it when your needs change. It's perfect for businesses that want to stay current with technology and market demands.\"\n\nFor $1 Buyout Lease:\n\"This structure gives you ownership certainty. You know exactly what you're getting, you build equity in the equipment, and you have complete control over your assets. It's perfect for businesses that want to own their equipment and benefit from long-term value.\"\n\nDECISION FRAMEWORK:\n1. Understand client's business model\n2. Assess equipment lifecycle expectations\n3. Evaluate client's accounting preferences\n4. Consider tax implications\n5. Analyze cash flow patterns\n6. Determine ownership preferences\n7. Match structure to client needs\n8. Present benefits clearly\n\nREAL-WORLD EXAMPLES:\nExample 1 - Medical Practice:\nClient: Dental practice with high-tech equipment\nChallenge: Technology advances rapidly; equipment becomes outdated\nSolution: FMV Lease\nOutcome: Practice upgrades equipment every 3 years, stays current with technology\n\nExample 2 - Construction Company:\nClient: Heavy equipment contractor\nChallenge: Equipment is core to business; long-term investment needed\nSolution: $1 Buyout\nOutcome: Company owns equipment, builds equity, controls maintenance\n\nOBJECTION HANDLING:\nObjection: \"I want to own my equipment.\"\nResponse: \"That's a great goal. With a $1 buyout lease, you get exactly that. You'll own the equipment at the end of the lease term, and you'll have built equity throughout the lease period. Plus, you get the benefit of lower upfront costs compared to a purchase.\"\n\nObjection: \"I don't want to be locked into a long-term commitment.\"\nResponse: \"I understand. With an FMV lease, you have flexibility. You can return the equipment at the end of the lease term, upgrade to newer models, or adjust your equipment portfolio as your business needs change. You're not locked in.\"");

You start with lower payments while you're ramping up, and as your business grows and revenue increases, your payments increase proportionally. It's like we're growing together. This is a win-win because you get the equipment you need now with manageable payments, and as your business succeeds, you can afford higher payments.\"\n\nFor Step-Down Payments:\n\"I've structured this lease to match your seasonal business cycle. During your peak season when you have the most cash available, you'll have higher payments. During your slower season, your payments decrease. This way, your lease payments align perfectly with when you actually have the cash to pay them. It's designed specifically for your business.\"\n\nCUSTOM SCHEDULES:\nYou can create virtually any payment schedule that makes sense for your client's business:\n\nExample 1 - Retail with Holiday Peak:\nJan-Oct: $2,000/month\nNov-Dec: $5,000/month\n\nExample 2 - Construction with Phases:\nPhase 1 (Months 1-6): $2,000/month\nPhase 2 (Months 7-18): $5,000/month\nPhase 3 (Months 19-24): $3,000/month\n\nExample 3 - Startup Growth:\nYear 1: $1,000/month\nYear 2: $1,500/month\nYear 3: $2,000/month\nYear 4: $2,500/month\nYear 5: $3,000/month\n\nREVENUE FORECAST MATCHING:\nThe best payment structures are based on actual revenue forecasts:\n\n1. Ask client for revenue projections\n2. Understand seasonal patterns\n3. Identify peak and slow periods\n4. Match payments to revenue timing\n5. Create custom schedule\n6. Present as partnership approach\n7. Build trust through understanding\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING:\nUse financial modeling to show the impact:\n\nScenario 1 - Fixed Payments:\nMonthly Payment: $2,500\nTotal 60 months: $150,000\nCash flow strain during slow periods\n\nScenario 2 - Step-Down Payments:\nPeak months (6): $4,000 = $24,000\nOff-season (54): $2,000 = $108,000\nTotal 60 months: $132,000\nBetter cash flow alignment\nLower total cost");

We work with your business cycle and create a payment schedule that makes sense for your cash flow. It's one of the advantages of leasing - we can be flexible in ways that traditional financing can't.\"\n\nObjection: \"Won't higher payments later be a problem?\"\nResponse: \"That's a great question. The whole point is that when payments are higher, your business is generating more revenue. We're matching payments to when you have the cash. If your business grows as projected, higher payments won't be a strain - they'll be proportional to your success.\"\n\nObjection: \"This seems complicated.\"\nResponse: \"I understand. Let me simplify it. We're just matching your lease payments to your actual business cycle. During your busy season, you have more cash, so you pay more. During your slow season, you have less cash, so you pay less. It's actually simpler than fixed payments because it matches reality.\"\n\nCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:\n\n1. Differentiation: Competitors offer fixed payments; you offer flexibility\n2. Deal Closure: Clients choose you because you understand their business\n3. Relationship Building: Demonstrates partnership mentality\n4. Client Retention: Clients appreciate the customization\n5. Referrals: Satisfied clients refer others\n6. Market Position: Known as the flexible, creative lessor\n7. Higher Close Rates: More deals close with flexible structures\n\n---\n\nSECTION C - DEFERRED COMMENCEMENT\n\nDEFINITION:\nDeferred commencement is a lease structure where the lessee can take possession and use the equipment immediately, but lease payments don't begin until a later date.\n\nAlternative Name: \"Use it now, pay later\" structure\n\nTHE 'USE IT NOW, PAY LATER' CONCEPT:\nCore Idea: Equipment is available for immediate business use, but payment obligations are deferred to a future date.\n\nExample:\n- Equipment delivered: January 1\n- Equipment use begins: January 1\n- Payment commencement: April 1 (3-month deferral)\n- First payment: April 1\n- Lease term: 60 months from April 1\n\nMECHANICS:\n\nHow Deferred Commencement Works:\n1. Equipment is selected and ordered\n2. Lease agreement is signed\n3. Equipment is delivered and installed\n4. Lessee begins using equipment immediately\n5. Lessee makes no payments during deferral period\n6. On commencement date, regular lease payments begin\n7. Lease term runs from commencement date\n\nDeferral Period Options:\n- 30 days\n- 60 days\n- 90 days\n- 6 months\n- Custom period\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nWhen to Use Deferred Commencement:\n1. Seasonal businesses: Defer payments until peak season\n2. Startup phase: Defer payments until revenue begins\n3. Project-based: Defer payments until project generates revenue\n4. Equipment ramp-up: Defer payments until equipment is fully productive\n5. Cash flow constraints: Defer payments until cash flow improves\n6. Seasonal hiring: Defer payments until new staff is productive\n\nTiming Strategy:\n- Identify when client will have cash available\n- Defer payments to that date\n- Ensure deferral period aligns with revenue generation\n- Create win-win timing");

You need this equipment now to take advantage of the opportunity in front of you. But I know cash is tight right now. So here's what we can do: You get the equipment immediately and start using it right away. But we don't start payments until [specific date when cash will be available]. That way, you get the equipment you need to seize this opportunity, and you don't have to worry about payments until you're generating revenue from it. It's a win-win.\"\n\nPitch 2 - The Seasonal Pitch:\n\"I know your business is seasonal. You're busy in [peak season] and slower in [off-season]. So here's what we can do: You get the equipment now so you're ready for your peak season. But we don't start payments until [peak season begins]. That way, you have the equipment ready, and you're not paying for it during your slow season. Your payments align perfectly with when you're making money.\"\n\nPitch 3 - The Growth Pitch:\n\"You're at an exciting point in your business. You're ready to grow, but you need equipment to make that growth happen. Here's what we can do: You get the equipment now and start using it immediately. But we don't start payments until [when growth revenue begins]. That way, you can invest in growth without the financial burden of payments during the startup phase. Once you're generating revenue from the growth, you start paying. It's designed to support your growth.\"");

But with deferred commencement, you can get the equipment now and take advantage of the opportunity. The window is closing, so we need to move on this.\"\n\nTechnique 2 - Competitive Pressure:\n\"Your competitors are already moving on this. If you wait, they'll get ahead of you. With deferred commencement, you can get the equipment now and stay competitive. Let's move quickly.\"\n\nTechnique 3 - Seasonal Timing:\n\"Your peak season is coming up. If you wait, you'll miss it. With deferred commencement, you can have the equipment ready for your peak season. We need to move now to make sure you're ready.\"\n\nCONCERN HANDLING:\n\nConcern: \"This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?\"\nResponse: \"There's no catch. We're just being flexible with timing. You get the equipment when you need it, and you pay when you have the cash. It's a partnership approach. The only thing that changes is when payments start - the total cost is the same.\"\n\nConcern: \"Will my payments be higher because of the deferral?\"\nResponse: \"No, your payments will be the same. We're just deferring when they start. The total cost of the lease is the same whether we defer or not. We're just aligning the payment timing with your cash flow.\"\n\nConcern: \"What if my revenue doesn't come in as expected?\"\nResponse: \"That's a fair concern. Let's build in some flexibility. We can structure this so that if your revenue is delayed, we can adjust the payment start date. We want this to work for your business, so we'll be flexible.\"\n\nFINANCIAL IMPACT:\n\nLessor Perspective:\n- Lessor bears risk of equipment sitting unused\n- Lessor has depreciation without corresponding income\n- Lessor must have strong credit analysis\n- Lessor must trust client's revenue projections\n- Lessor benefits from higher lease rates (risk premium)\n\nLessee Perspective:\n- Lessee gets equipment immediately\n- Lessee defers payment burden\n- Lessee can generate revenue before paying\n- Lessee improves cash flow\n- Lessee gets competitive advantage\n\n---\n\nBEST PRACTICES\n\nCLIENT NEEDS ANALYSIS:\n1.
