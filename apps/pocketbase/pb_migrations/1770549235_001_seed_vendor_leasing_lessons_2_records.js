It requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet.\n\n### IFRS 16 (International Standards)\nIFRS 16 is the International Financial Reporting Standards equivalent, effective January 1, 2019. It provides similar requirements to ASC 842 with some differences in application.\n\n## Lease Classification\n\n### Finance Leases (ASC 842)\nA lease is classified as a finance lease if it meets any of the following criteria:\n1. The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term\n2. The lessee has an option to purchase the underlying asset that it is reasonably certain to exercise\n3. The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset\n4. The sum of the present value of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset\n5. The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term\n\n### Operating Leases\nLeases that do not meet any of the finance lease criteria are classified as operating leases.\n\n## Recognition and Measurement\n\n### Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset\nAt lease commencement, the lessee recognizes a ROU asset measured as:\n- Lease liability amount\n- Plus: Lease payments made at or before commencement\n- Plus: Initial direct costs\n- Less: Lease incentives received\n\n### Lease Liability\nThe lease liability is measured as the present value of:\n- Fixed lease payments\n- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate\n- Residual value guarantees\n- Lessee's option to purchase the asset (if reasonably certain to exercise)\n- Lessee's option to terminate the lease (if reasonably certain to exercise)\n\nThe discount rate used is the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Financial Statement Presentation\n\n### Balance Sheet\n- ROU asset: Presented separately or within property, plant, and equipment\n- Lease liability: Separated into current and non-current portions\n\n### Income Statement\n- Finance leases: Interest expense and depreciation expense\n- Operating leases: Lease expense (straight-line over lease term)\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- Principal payments: Operating or financing activities (depending on classification)\n- Interest payments: Operating activities\n\n## Disclosure Requirements\n\n### Quantitative Disclosures\n1. ROU assets by lease classification\n2. Lease liabilities by lease classification\n3. Lease expense by classification\n4. Weighted-average remaining lease term\n5. Weighted-average discount rate\n6. Maturity analysis of lease payments\n7. Operating cash outflows for operating leases\n\n### Qualitative Disclosures\n1. Nature of leasing activities\n2. Lease terms and conditions\n3. Restrictions or covenants\n4. Significant judgments and estimates\n5. Subsequent events affecting leases\n\n## Key Differences: ASC 842 vs IFRS 16\n\n1. **Lease Definition**: IFRS 16 has a more principle-based definition\n2. **Short-term Lease Exemption**: Both allow exemption for leases \u226412 months\n3. **Low-value Asset Exemption**: Both allow exemption for low-value assets\n4. **Subsequent Measurement**: Similar approaches with minor differences\n5. **Transition**: Different effective dates and transition methods\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n### Initial Assessment\n- Identify all lease arrangements\n- Determine lease classification\n- Gather lease terms and conditions\n- Obtain market data for discount rates\n\n### Ongoing Management\n- Monitor lease modifications\n- Track variable lease payments\n- Assess residual value guarantees\n- Update discount rates if applicable\n- Maintain detailed lease schedules\n\n## Common Challenges\n\n1. **Identifying Leases**: Determining whether arrangements contain leases\n2. **Discount Rate Selection**: Estimating incremental borrowing rates\n3. **Lease Modifications**: Accounting for changes to lease terms\n4. **Variable Payments**: Estimating future variable lease payments\n5. **Residual Value**: Assessing residual value guarantees\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Implement a lease accounting system\n2. Maintain centralized lease documentation\n3. Establish clear policies and procedures\n4. Conduct regular training for accounting staff\n5. Perform quarterly reviews and updates\n6. Maintain audit trails for all lease transactions");
