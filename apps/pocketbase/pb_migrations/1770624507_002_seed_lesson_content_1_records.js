Recognition Criteria: Identify the lease, determine the lease term, identify lease payments, measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Right-of-Use Assets: Initial measurement at cost, includes lease payments, direct costs, restoration obligations. Lease Liabilities: Present value of lease payments, discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. Initial Measurement: ROU asset = lease liability + initial direct costs + restoration costs - lease incentives. Subsequent Measurement: Depreciate ROU asset, accrue interest on lease liability, remeasure for modifications. Practical Examples: Equipment leases, vehicle leases, real estate leases");
