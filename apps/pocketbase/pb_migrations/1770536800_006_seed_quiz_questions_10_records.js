They are presented as non-current assets (unless short-term). The presentation should clearly distinguish between lease types. Some companies combine them with other assets but must disclose the ROU asset amount. The ROU asset is depreciated over the lease term.");
    record0.set("explanation", "Clear presentation of ROU assets is important for financial statement users to understand the company's lease obligations.

This classification affects the balance sheet presentation and working capital ratios. The current portion includes both principal and interest components of lease payments due within the next year.

This is different from finance leases, which have front-loaded expenses due to the interest component. The straight-line approach makes operating lease expenses easier to forecast and more consistent year-to-year.");

This differs from the income statement where lease expense is recognized. The reconciliation between lease expense and cash payments is important for understanding cash flow impact.");
    record3.set("explanation", "The cash flow statement presentation is complex because lease payments are split between operating and financing activities. For operating leases, the entire payment is operating cash flow. For finance leases, the interest is operating and principal is financing. This reclassification can significantly impact operating cash flow metrics used by investors and analysts.");

Companies with large lease portfolios (retail, airlines, real estate) experience the most significant impact.");
    record4.set("explanation", "The inclusion of lease liabilities in debt calculations is one of the most significant impacts of ASC 842. A 12% increase in debt-to-equity can trigger covenant violations or credit rating downgrades. This is why many companies were concerned about ASC 842 implementation.

Finance lease expense is split: depreciation is in operating income, interest is in non-operating income. This split presentation can make finance leases appear more expensive than operating leases, even if the total cost is similar.");

The formula becomes: Interest Coverage = EBITDA / (Interest Expense + Finance Lease Interest). This decrease can affect covenant compliance and credit ratings.");
    record6.set("explanation", "Interest coverage is a key metric for lenders and investors. The addition of lease interest expense reduces this ratio, potentially indicating higher financial risk. Some analysts adjust EBITDA by adding back lease expense to calculate adjusted interest coverage, which provides a more comparable metric across companies with different lease structures.");

The impact is more significant for asset-heavy companies with large lease portfolios. For example, a retail company with $500M in ROU assets and $45M annual lease expense would see ROA decrease by 1-2 percentage points.");
    record7.set("explanation", "ROA is a measure of how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. The addition of ROU assets increases the denominator without a corresponding increase in net income, reducing the ratio. This makes companies with significant leases appear less efficient, even if their operational performance hasn't changed. Adjusted ROA (excluding lease impact) is often used for comparison.");

    record9.set("explanation", "Adjusted EBITDA adds back lease-related expenses to provide a comparable metric across companies with different lease structures. Operating lease expense is added back because it's a financing decision (lease vs buy). Finance lease interest is added back to normalize the financing component. This adjusted metric is useful for valuation and covenant calculations, as it removes the impact of lease accounting differences.");
