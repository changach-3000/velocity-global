CAPITAL LEASES\n\nDefinitions and Characteristics:\n- Operating Lease: Short-term lease where lessor retains ownership risks and benefits. Lessee has use of asset but no ownership. Typically cancellable. Examples: car rentals, equipment rentals.\n- Capital Lease: Long-term lease that transfers substantially all risks and benefits of ownership to lessee. Lessee effectively owns the asset. Non-cancellable. Examples: equipment financing, real estate leases.\n\nTax Implications:\n- Operating Lease: Lease payments are fully deductible as business expense. No depreciation deduction. No interest deduction (interest is embedded in lease payment).\n- Capital Lease: Lessee deducts depreciation on capitalized asset and interest on lease liability. Lessor deducts depreciation and interest income.\n\nKey Differences:\n| Aspect | Operating Lease | Capital Lease |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Ownership | Lessor retains | Transfers to lessee |\n| Accounting | Expense | Asset/Liability |\n| Tax Treatment | Lease deduction | Depreciation + Interest |\n| Balance Sheet | Off-balance sheet | On-balance sheet |\n| Cancellation | Typically cancellable | Non-cancellable |\n\nTAX TREATMENT DETAILS\n\nOperating Lease Tax Deduction:\n- Lease payments are ordinary and necessary business expenses\n- Fully deductible in year paid\n- No capitalization required\n- No depreciation recapture on termination\n- Example: $12,000 annual lease payment = $12,000 tax deduction\n\nCapital Lease Tax Treatment:\n- Asset capitalized at fair value or present value of lease payments\n- Depreciation deducted using MACRS over recovery period\n- Interest portion of lease payment deducted as interest expense\n- Depreciation recapture on disposition\n- Example: $500K capitalized asset, 5-year MACRS = $100K annual depreciation\n\nASC 842 IMPACT\n\nRight-of-Use (ROU) Asset:\n- All leases (operating and finance) recognized on balance sheet\n- ROU asset = present value of lease payments + initial direct costs - lease incentives\n- Amortized over lease term\n- Example: $500K lease, 5-year term, 5% discount rate = $432K ROU asset\n\nLease Liability:\n- Present value of remaining lease payments\n- Decreases as payments are made\n- Interest accrued each period\n- Example: $500K lease payments, 5% rate = $432K initial liability\n\nBook-Tax Differences:\n- Operating lease: ROU asset amortization \u2260 tax deduction (straight-line vs. lease payment timing)\n- Finance lease: Depreciation \u2260 ROU amortization; Interest \u2260 interest expense\n- Creates deferred tax assets/liabilities\n- Example: Year 1 ROU amortization $86.4K vs. lease deduction $120K = $33.6K deferred tax asset\n\nDeferred Tax Implications:\n- Temporary differences between book and tax\n- Deferred tax asset/liability recognized\n- Valuation allowance may be required\n- Schedule M-1/M-3 adjustments required\n\nTAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nLease vs. Buy Analysis:\n1. Calculate after-tax cost of leasing\n2. Calculate after-tax cost of buying\n3. Compare present values\n4. Consider tax rate changes\n5. Evaluate cash flow timing\n\nExample Analysis:\nAsset Cost: $500,000\nLease Payment: $12,000/month ($144,000/year)\nLoan Rate: 5%\nTax Rate: 21%\nUseful Life: 8 years\nMACS Recovery: 5 years\n\nLease Cost (after-tax):\n- Annual payment: $144,000\n- Tax savings: $144,000 \u00d7 21% = $30,240\n- After-tax cost: $144,000 - $30,240 = $113,760\n- 5-year PV @ 4% (5% \u00d7 (1-21%)): $493,000\n\nBuy Cost (after-tax):\n- Year 1 Depreciation: $100,000 (20% MACRS)\n- Year 1 Interest: $25,000 (5% \u00d7 $500K)\n- Year 1 Tax deductions: $125,000\n- Year 1 Tax savings: $125,000 \u00d7 21% = $26,250\n- Year 1 After-tax cost: $500,000 - $26,250 = $473,750\n- 5-year PV: $485,000\n\nConclusion: Buying is slightly cheaper ($485K vs. $493K)\n\nTiming Strategies:\n- Year-end purchases to maximize depreciation\n- Bonus depreciation timing\n- Section 179 expensing timing\n- Lease vs. buy timing\n\nEntity Structure Considerations:\n- C Corporation: 21% tax rate, double taxation on distributions\n- S Corporation: Pass-through, 37% top rate, self-employment tax savings\n- Partnership/LLC: Pass-through, 37% top rate, flexible allocation\n- Sole Proprietorship: Pass-through, 37% top rate, self-employment tax");
