    record0.set("explanation", "Correct! A Sale and Leaseback structure is commonly used to monetize fixed assets (convert them to cash) and improve immediate cash flow. The company sells an owned asset to a buyer (often a leasing company or financial institution) and simultaneously leases it back. This allows the company to unlock capital tied up in the asset while maintaining operational use of the asset. Option A is incorrect because Sale and Leaseback does not increase the number of assets owned - ownership changes but the number of assets in use remains the same. Option B is incorrect because Sale and Leaseback has nothing to do with avoiding manufacturer payments. Option C is incorrect because Sale and Leaseback transactions must be properly disclosed and accounted for under IFRS 16 and ASC 842.");
