A portfolio of 1,000+ leases with $500M in total value requires robust systems.");

Prevention strategies: (1) Comprehensive contract review process, (2) Centralized lease register, (3) Clear lease identification policies, (4) Training for procurement and legal teams, (5) Regular audits of lease register, (6) Standardized documentation templates.");
    record3.set("explanation", "Lease identification is one of the most challenging aspects of ASC 842 implementation.

For a company with 1,000+ leases, a centralized discount rate policy ensures consistency. Rates should be reviewed quarterly and updated if market conditions change by more than 0.5-1.0%.");
    record5.set("explanation", "Discount rate selection is one of the most sensitive variables in lease accounting. A consistent, well-documented policy is essential. Many companies use a tiered approach with different rates for different lease terms and risk profiles.

Avoidance strategies: (1) Allocate sufficient resources and time, (2) Establish clear governance and accountability, (3) Implement strong project management, (4) Conduct comprehensive training, (5) Perform thorough testing, (6) Establish strong internal controls, (7) Maintain detailed documentation.");
    record6.set("explanation", "Many companies underestimated the effort required for ASC 842 implementation.
