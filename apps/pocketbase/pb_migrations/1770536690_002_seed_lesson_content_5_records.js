Understanding ASC 842 is essential for accurate financial reporting and strategic planning.\n\n(2) ASC 842 OVERVIEW AND IMPACT (12 min)\nWhat is ASC 842?\n- ASC 842 is the FASB's new lease accounting standard effective for public companies in 2019 and private companies in 2022\n- Replaces the previous ASC 840 standard\n- Requires recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet\n\nKey Differences from Old Accounting:\n- Old standard: Operating leases were off-balance sheet\n- New standard: All leases (except short-term) must be recognized on balance sheet\n- Significant impact on financial metrics and ratios\n\nImpact on Financial Statements:\n- Balance sheet: Increased assets and liabilities\n- Income statement: Different expense recognition pattern\n- Cash flow: Reclassification of lease payments\n- Financial ratios: Debt-to-equity, interest coverage, ROA all affected\n\nReal-World Examples:\n- Retail companies with store leases: Significant balance sheet impact\n- Airlines with aircraft leases: Major liability recognition\n- Technology companies with office leases: Moderate impact\n\n(3) RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY (15 min)\nDefinition and Recognition:\n- ROU Asset: Represents the right to use the leased asset over the lease term\n- Lease Liability: Represents the obligation to make lease payments\n- Both must be recognized at lease commencement date\n\nCalculation Methodology:\n- ROU Asset = Lease Liability + Initial Direct Costs - Lease Incentives\n- Lease Liability = PV of lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate\n\nInitial and Subsequent Measurement:\n- Initial: ROU asset and liability recognized at lease commencement\n- Subsequent: Liability decreases with payments, asset decreases with depreciation\n- Remeasurement required if lease terms change\n\nPractical Example - $10M Lease:\n- Lease amount: $10,000,000\n- Lease term: 5 years\n- Annual payment: $2,500,000\n- Discount rate: 5%\n- ROU Asset: $10,833,000 (includes initial direct costs)\n- Lease Liability: $10,833,000\n- Year 1 Lease Expense: $2,166,600 (depreciation + interest)\n- Year 1 Interest Expense: $541,650\n- Year 1 Depreciation: $1,624,950\n\n(4) LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION (12 min)\nOperating vs Finance Leases:\n- Operating Lease: Short-term, lessor retains ownership risks/benefits\n- Finance Lease: Long-term, lessee assumes ownership risks/benefits\n- Classification affects expense recognition pattern\n\nLease Identification:\n- Must identify all lease components in contracts\n- Distinguish between lease and non-lease components\n- Consider variable lease payments\n\nPractical Examples:\n- Equipment lease with buyout option: Finance lease\n- Store lease with renewal options: Operating lease\n- Vehicle lease with maintenance: Mixed components\n\n(5) FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT (10 min)\nBalance Sheet Impact:\n- Total assets increase by ROU asset amount\n- Total liabilities increase by lease liability amount\n- Working capital ratios affected\n\nIncome Statement Impact:\n- Operating lease: Straight-line expense recognition\n- Finance lease: Front-loaded expense (interest + depreciation)\n- Operating income affected\n\nKey Metrics Affected:\n- Debt-to-equity ratio: Increases by approximately 15% for companies with significant leases\n- Current ratio: May decrease due to current portion of lease liability\n- Interest coverage: Decreases due to additional interest expense\n\n(6) PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION TIPS (6 min)\nCommon Challenges:\n- Identifying all leases in the organization\n- Determining appropriate discount rates\n- Tracking lease modifications\n- Managing data and documentation\n\nBest Practices:\n- Implement centralized lease tracking system\n- Establish clear policies for lease identification\n- Document all lease terms and assumptions\n- Regular training for accounting teams\n\nTechnology Solutions:\n- Lease accounting software (e.g., Lease Accounting Software, Domo, Coupa)\n- Integration with ERP systems\n- Automated calculations and reporting\n- Audit trail and compliance features");

Proper analysis ensures optimal capital allocation and maximizes shareholder value.\n\n(2) LEASE VS BUY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS (15 min)\nSetting Up the Comparison:\n- Identify all relevant cash flows for both options\n- Establish appropriate discount rate\n- Determine analysis period (typically asset useful life)\n\nIdentifying Cash Flows:\n- Lease option: Lease payments, tax benefits, residual value\n- Buy option: Purchase price, maintenance, insurance, taxes, residual value\n- Exclude sunk costs and financing costs\n\nDiscount Rate Selection:\n- Use company's after-tax cost of debt\n- Reflects risk of lease payments (contractual obligations)\n- Typical range: 4-8% depending on company credit rating\n\nNPV and IRR Analysis:\n- NPV: Net present value of lease vs buy cash flows\n- IRR: Internal rate of return for each option\n- Choose option with higher NPV or lower cost\n\nPractical $5M Equipment Example:\n- Equipment cost: $5,000,000\n- Lease term: 5 years\n- Annual lease payment: $1,200,000\n- Annual maintenance (buy): $150,000\n- Residual value (buy): $1,000,000\n- Tax rate: 25%\n- Discount rate: 5%\n- Lease NPV: $2,100,000\n- Buy NPV: $2,800,000\n- Recommendation: Buy option is more economical\n\n(3) CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR LEASES (12 min)\nLease Payments:\n- Fixed payments over lease term\n- Variable payments (if applicable)\n- Contingent rentals\n\nTax Cash Flows:\n- Lease payments are tax deductible\n- Tax shield = Lease payment \u00d7 Tax rate\n- Timing of tax deductions\n\nResidual Value:\n- Estimated value at end of lease\n- Affects buy option economics\n- Uncertainty in residual value\n\nMaintenance and Insurance:\n- Typically included in lease payments\n- Separate costs if buying\n- Impact on total cost of ownership\n\nTiming Considerations:\n- Lease payments typically made at beginning of period\n- Tax deductions taken when paid\n- Residual value realized at end of lease\n\n(4) SENSITIVITY AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS (15 min)\nKey Variables:\n- Discount rate (\u00b11-2%)\n- Lease payment amounts\n- Residual value\n- Maintenance costs\n- Tax rate\n\nSensitivity Methodology:\n- Change one variable at a time\n- Measure impact on NPV\n- Identify critical variables\n- Create sensitivity tables\n\nScenario Analysis:\n- Best case: Favorable assumptions\n- Base case: Most likely assumptions\n- Worst case: Unfavorable assumptions\n- Probability-weighted outcomes\n\nBreak-Even Analysis:\n- At what discount rate are options equal?\n- At what residual value are options equal?\n- Helps identify decision thresholds\n\nPractical Examples:\n- If discount rate increases to 6%, lease NPV becomes $2,050,000\n- If residual value decreases to $800,000, buy NPV becomes $2,600,000\n- Break-even discount rate: 5.2%\n\n(5) FINANCIAL METRICS AND KPIs (10 min)\nPayback Period:\n- Time to recover initial investment\n- Lease: 3.2 years\n- Buy: 3.5 years\n- Shorter payback preferred\n\nProfitability Index:\n- PV of benefits / PV of costs\n- Lease: 1.12\n- Buy: 1.15\n- Higher index preferred\n\nROI (Return on Investment):\n- Annual return on capital invested\n- Helps compare to other investments\n- Typical range: 8-15%\n\nIRR (Internal Rate of Return):\n- Lease IRR: 6.2%\n- Buy IRR: 5.8%\n- Higher IRR preferred\n\nNPV (Net Present Value):\n- Absolute dollar benefit\n- Lease NPV: $2,100,000\n- Buy NPV: $2,800,000\n- Higher NPV preferred\n\n(6) DECISION FRAMEWORK (3 min)\nIntegrating Factors:\n- Financial analysis (primary)\n- Operational flexibility\n- Balance sheet impact\n- Strategic considerations\n- Risk tolerance\n\nFinal Decision:\n- Quantitative analysis provides foundation\n- Qualitative factors may override\n- Document decision rationale\n- Communicate to stakeholders\n\nDocumentation:\n- Maintain analysis workpapers\n- Document assumptions and sources\n- Record decision and approval\n- Track actual vs projected results");
