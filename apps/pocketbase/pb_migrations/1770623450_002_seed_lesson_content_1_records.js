US GAAP LEASE CLASSIFICATION\n- ASC 842 eliminates the operating vs finance lease distinction for lessees\n- All leases result in ROU asset and lease liability recognition\n- Lessor classification remains: sales-type, direct financing, or operating leases\n- Classification affects lessor accounting and financial statement presentation\n\n2. OPERATING VS FINANCE LEASES (LESSOR PERSPECTIVE)\n- Sales-Type Lease: Lessor transfers control of asset, recognizes sales revenue and cost of goods sold\n- Direct Financing Lease: Lessor finances asset, recognizes interest income over lease term\n- Operating Lease: Lessor retains control, recognizes lease revenue and depreciation expense\n- Classification criteria: transfer of control, lease term, present value of payments, asset specialization\n\n3. LESSEE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n- All leases recognized on balance sheet (ROU asset and lease liability)\n- Operating leases: straight-line expense recognition\n- Finance leases: front-loaded expense recognition (interest + depreciation)\n- Lease classification affects income statement presentation but not balance sheet recognition\n\n4. LEASE LIABILITY CALCULATION\n- Present value of lease payments discounted at: incremental borrowing rate or implicit rate (if known)\n- Lease payments include: fixed payments, variable payments linked to index/rate, residual value guarantees, termination penalties\n- Excludes: variable payments not linked to index/rate, service components, taxes\n- Remeasured when lease modifications occur or contingencies are resolved\n\n5. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET RECOGNITION\n- Initial measurement: Lease Liability + Initial Direct Costs + Prepaid Lease Payments - Lease Incentives\n- Represents lessee's right to use the underlying asset during lease term\n- Depreciated over lease term using straight-line method\n- Subject to impairment testing under ASC 360 (Property, Plant & Equipment)\n- Adjusted for lease modifications and remeasurements\n\n6. DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINATION\n- Primary: Implicit rate in the lease (if readily determinable)\n- Implicit rate: Rate that makes PV of lease payments equal to fair value of asset\n- Secondary: Incremental borrowing rate (if implicit rate not readily determinable)\n- Incremental borrowing rate: Rate lessee would pay to borrow funds for similar term and security\n- Determination: Consider credit rating, collateral, lease term, economic environment\n\n7. LEASE TERM AND PAYMENTS\n- Lease term: Non-cancellable period + periods covered by renewal/termination options reasonably certain to be exercised\n- Reasonably certain: Lessee has significant economic incentive to exercise option\n- Lease payments: Fixed payments, variable payments linked to index/rate, residual guarantees, termination penalties\n- Excludes: Variable payments not linked to index/rate, service/maintenance costs, taxes\n- Reassess lease term and payments when facts/circumstances change\n\n8. TRANSITION AND EFFECTIVE DATE\n- Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018\n- Modified retrospective approach: Cumulative effect recognized at adoption date\n- Comparative periods not restated\n- Practical expedients available: short-term leases, low-value assets, hindsight in determining lease term");
