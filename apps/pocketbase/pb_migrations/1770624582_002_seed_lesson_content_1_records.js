Lease Definition: Right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time. Recognition Criteria: Identify the lease, determine the lease term, identify lease payments, measure ROU asset and lease liability.

Measurement Principles: Initial measurement, subsequent measurement, lease modifications. Lease Liability Calculation: Present value of lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-Use Asset Recognition: Initial cost includes lease liability, initial direct costs, restoration obligations. Discount Rate Determination: Incremental borrowing rate or implicit rate if known. Lease Term and Payments: Determination of lease term, identification of lease payments. Practical Examples: Equipment leases, vehicle leases, real estate leases under US GAAP");
