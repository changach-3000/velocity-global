The CFO was initially skeptical about leasing, preferring ownership. The leasing company presented a comprehensive multi-option proposal with three distinct options: (1) Purchase with Cash ($830,000 total 5-year cost), (2) Purchase with Financing ($866,000 total 5-year cost), (3) Lease ($690,000 total 5-year cost, recommended). The multi-option approach gave MediCare control over the decision and made the financial advantages of leasing obvious through data-driven comparison. MediCare chose the lease option and signed a 5-year agreement for $11,500/month. Year 1-2 results showed 12% increase in patient volume, $180,000/year additional revenue, and zero downtime. At Year 5, the leasing company implemented a proactive upgrade strategy 90 days before lease expiration, presenting new advanced diagnostic imaging technology. MediCare upgraded to new equipment for $13,200/month (5-year lease), generating $250,000/year additional revenue. Over 10 years, MediCare generated $668,000 net benefit from leasing vs purchasing, and the leasing company created a lifetime customer with expanded relationship across 8 locations.");
