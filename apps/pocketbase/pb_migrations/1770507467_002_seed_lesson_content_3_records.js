Comprehensive documentation protects all parties and ensures compliance with accounting standards.\n\n## Lease Agreement Structure\nA comprehensive lease agreement consists of five main sections:\n1. **Preamble and Parties** - Identification of lessor/lessee, effective date, equipment description\n2. **Payment Terms** - Lease payment amounts, schedule, escalation clauses, residual guarantees\n3. **Rights and Responsibilities** - Allocation of maintenance, insurance, tax responsibilities\n4. **Default and Remedies** - Definition of defaults, cure periods, available remedies\n5. **General Provisions** - Governing law, dispute resolution, amendment procedures\n\n## Key Agreement Sections\n- **Lease Commencement and Term** - Non-cancellable period plus renewal options\n- **Payment Obligations** - Fixed/variable payments, residual guarantees, contingent rent\n- **Maintenance and Repairs** - Routine vs. major repair responsibility allocation\n- **Insurance and Risk** - Required coverage types, risk allocation, indemnification\n- **Default and Termination** - Default events, cure periods, termination procedures\n\n## Legal Structures\n1. **Operating Lease** - Lessor retains ownership, shorter term, lessor bears residual risk\n2. **Finance Lease** - Lessee effectively owns asset, longer term, lessee bears residual risk\n3. **Sale-Leaseback** - Asset owner sells then leases back, provides liquidity\n4. **Leveraged Lease** - Lessor uses debt financing, multiple parties involved\n5. **Cross-Border Lease** - Lessor and lessee in different countries, complex documentation\n\n## Documentation Best Practices\n1. **Clarity and Precision** - Use clear language, define all terms, avoid contradictions\n2. **Completeness** - Address all material terms, include required disclosures\n3. **Compliance** - Ensure compliance with laws and accounting standards\n4. **Risk Allocation** - Clearly allocate all risks, specify insurance requirements\n5. **Flexibility** - Include amendment procedures, renewal/extension provisions\n\n## Case Study: DocumentCorp\nDocumentCorp leased specialized scanning equipment for 5 years at $15,000/month. Comprehensive documentation included detailed maintenance responsibilities, insurance requirements ($500K comprehensive, $1M liability), and clear default provisions with 30-day cure period. The structured approach prevented disputes and enabled successful lease renewal.");

Key changes from ASC 840: ROU asset recognition, lease liability recognition, balance sheet impact, split income statement expense, and financing activity classification.\n\n## Lease Classification\n**Operating Leases**: Lessor retains ownership, shorter term, lessor bears residual risk. Straight-line lease expense over term.\n\n**Finance Leases**: Lessee effectively owns asset, longer term, lessee bears residual risk. Front-loaded expense pattern (depreciation + interest).\n\n## ASC 842 Accounting Entries\n1. **Lease Commencement** - Debit ROU Asset, Credit Lease Liability (PV of payments)\n2. **Lease Payment** - Debit Liability/Interest, Credit Cash\n3. **ROU Amortization (Operating)** - Debit Lease Expense, Credit ROU Asset (straight-line)\n4. **ROU Depreciation (Finance)** - Debit Depreciation, Credit Accumulated Depreciation\n\n## Financial Statement Impact\n**Balance Sheet**: ROU Asset and Lease Liability both recognized at commencement, decrease over term.\n\n**Income Statement**: Operating leases show level expense; Finance leases show front-loaded expense (higher early, lower later).\n\n**Cash Flow**: Operating leases classified as financing; Finance leases split between operating (interest) and financing (principal).\n\n## IFRS 16 Treatment\nIFRS 16 is similar to ASC 842 with key differences: broader lease definition, different discount rate selection, low-value asset exemption, and similar lessor accounting. Both standards require ROU asset and lease liability recognition.\n\n## Case Study: AccountingCorp\nAccountingCorp leased office equipment for 5 years at $100K annually. Equipment fair value: $450K, useful life: 10 years, discount rate: 5%. PV of payments: $432,948 (86% of fair value). Classified as operating lease. Year 1: Lease Expense $100K, Interest Expense $21,397, ROU Asset reduced to $332,948, Lease Liability to $354,345. Proper classification ensured accurate financial reporting.");

Assess credit history, financial ratios, industry conditions.\n2. **Residual Value Risk** - Asset value decline at lease end. Research historical values, obsolescence trends, market demand.\n3. **Operational Risk** - Asset operation and maintenance issues. Assess operator capabilities, maintenance history, insurance.\n4. **Legal/Regulatory Risk** - Law changes, regulatory compliance, litigation. Monitor regulations, assess jurisdiction, evaluate compliance.\n5. **Market/Economic Risk** - Economic changes affecting lease viability. Analyze industry trends, economic indicators, competitive landscape.\n\n## Risk Assessment Methods\n1. **Quantitative Analysis** - Probability analysis, impact quantification, expected value calculation, sensitivity/scenario analysis.\n2. **Qualitative Analysis** - Risk ratings, risk matrices, expert interviews, comparative analysis, trend analysis.\n3. **Financial Ratio Analysis** - Debt-to-equity, current ratio, interest coverage, ROA to assess credit quality.\n4. **Stress Testing** - Model recession, industry downturn, rate increases, residual decline, operational disruption scenarios.\n5. **Benchmarking** - Compare to similar lessees, assets, structures, market conditions, lessor experience.\n\n## Risk Mitigation Strategies\n1. **Credit Enhancement** - Parent guarantees, collateral, letters of credit, security deposits, financial covenants.\n2. **Residual Value Protection** - Residual guarantees, insurance, buyback agreements, maintenance requirements, usage restrictions.\n3. **Operational Risk Management** - Maintenance schedules, insurance requirements, inspection rights, operator training, performance monitoring.\n4. **Legal/Regulatory Protection** - Comprehensive documentation, regulatory compliance, tax indemnification, environmental compliance, dispute resolution.\n5. **Economic/Market Risk Management** - Portfolio diversification, hedging, escalation clauses, flexible terms, market monitoring.\n\n## Structuring Best Practices\n1. **Comprehensive Due Diligence** - Lessee analysis, asset analysis, market analysis, legal analysis, documentation review.\n2. **Clear Documentation** - Payment terms, rights/obligations, default provisions, termination procedures, dispute resolution.\n3. **Appropriate Risk Allocation** - Lessor manages residual, lessee manages operational, shared risks allocated appropriately.\n4. **Appropriate Pricing** - Include cost of funds, risk premium, residual assumptions, competitive rates, adequate return.\n5. **Ongoing Monitoring** - Payment tracking, financial monitoring, asset condition, compliance monitoring, market monitoring.\n\n## Case Study: RiskManagementCorp\nRiskManagementCorp structured a $5M, 7-year lease for specialized manufacturing equipment. Lessee: BB-rated manufacturer with 2.0 debt-to-equity. Identified: moderate credit risk, high residual risk, low operational risk. Mitigation: 50% parent guarantee, 6-month security deposit, residual guarantee at 45%, residual insurance, quarterly inspections, comprehensive documentation. Result: Successful execution, on-time payments, asset maintained, residual tracking to estimate, expected return achieved.");
