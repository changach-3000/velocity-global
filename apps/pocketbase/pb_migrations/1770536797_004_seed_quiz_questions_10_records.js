    record0.set("correct_answer", "ASC 842 is the FASB's new lease accounting standard that requires recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases (except short-term). Its primary impact is bringing previously off-balance sheet operating leases onto the balance sheet, significantly affecting financial statements, debt ratios, and financial metrics.");
    record0.set("explanation", "ASC 842 fundamentally changed lease accounting by requiring balance sheet recognition. This is a major shift from the previous standard (ASC 840) where operating leases were off-balance sheet. The standard applies to public companies since 2019 and private companies since 2022.");

    record1.set("explanation", "The lease expense calculation requires understanding the components: (1) Interest is calculated on the remaining lease liability balance, (2) Depreciation is the ROU asset divided by the lease term. Year 1 has the highest interest because the liability balance is highest. As payments are made, the liability decreases, reducing interest expense in subsequent years.");

Both are recognized at the lease commencement date and are typically equal in amount initially, though they change differently over time (asset decreases via depreciation, liability decreases via payments).");

Finance leases: Front-loaded expense pattern with higher expenses in early years due to higher interest component, decreasing over time as interest declines and principal increases.");
    record3.set("explanation", "This is a critical distinction. Operating leases produce consistent expense each year, making them easier to forecast. Finance leases have declining interest expense and constant depreciation, resulting in higher total expenses early in the lease term. This affects both income statement presentation and cash flow analysis.");

    record4.set("explanation", "The most significant change from ASC 840 to ASC 842 is the balance sheet recognition requirement. Under ASC 840, operating leases were off-balance sheet, which understated liabilities and overstated financial ratios. ASC 842 brings all leases (except short-term) onto the balance sheet, providing more transparent financial reporting.");

Factors include: company credit rating, market interest rates, lease term, collateral value, and comparable borrowing rates. Typical range is 4-8%.");
    record5.set("explanation", "The discount rate is critical because it directly affects the ROU asset and lease liability calculations. A higher discount rate results in lower present values, while a lower rate results in higher present values. The rate should reflect the risk of the lease payments, not the lessor's rate or the company's overall cost of capital.");

    record6.set("explanation", "Lease liabilities are now included in total debt under ASC 842. This increases the debt-to-equity ratio, typically by 10-15% for companies with significant lease portfolios. This is one of the most significant impacts of ASC 842 on financial metrics and can affect debt covenants and credit ratings.");

The Lease Liability is the present value of lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate. Initial direct costs are costs incurred to obtain the lease. Lease incentives are amounts paid by the lessor to the lessee.");
    record7.set("explanation", "The ROU Asset is not simply equal to the Lease Liability. It must be adjusted for initial direct costs (which increase the asset) and lease incentives (which decrease the asset). This is why the ROU Asset and Lease Liability may differ at the commencement date, though they are often similar in amount.");

    record8.set("explanation", "ASC 842 implementation is complex because it requires identifying all leases (not just formal lease agreements), establishing consistent policies, and often implementing new systems.
