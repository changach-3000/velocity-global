    answer: "Equipment leasing is a financing option where you rent equipment for a specific period instead of buying it upfront. This allows you to preserve capital while accessing the latest technology.",
    detailedAnswer: "Equipment leasing is essentially a rental agreement for business assets. Instead of paying the full cost of equipment upfront, you pay a monthly fee to use it. At the end of the lease term, you may have the option to buy the equipment, return it, or upgrade to newer models. This is popular for businesses that need to manage cash flow or use equipment that depreciates quickly.",
